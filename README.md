Leading with a servant leadership model, I believe in empowering teams to solve tough challenges and deliver value. Over my career, I've enjoyed working with smart, diverse groups of people, and together, we've launched successful products in multiple languages and markets.

When not at work, I enjoy coming up with new [playlists](https://abiassi.com/playlists). I'm always open to connecting and discussing music, tech, or the latest design topic.
